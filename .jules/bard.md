## 2024-05-10 - [Rect Module Documentation]
**Confusion:** The 2D primitive rendering for rectangles was entirely undocumented, leading to confusion on what parameters it takes and what it does.
**Clarification:** Added a module-level doc `//!` explaining its use cases, and added docstrings for `draw_rect`, `fill_rect`, `draw_rounded_rect`, and `fill_rounded_rect` including parameters and executable doctests.
## 2024-05-11 - [Ellipse Rasterization]
**Confusion:** The `draw_ellipse` and `fill_ellipse` functions were missing documentation, leaving developers confused about their coordinate bounds handling and inner loop performance characteristics.
**Clarification:** Added complete module and function documentation emphasizing the bounds-free fast-path logic and performance characteristics. Supplied copy-pasteable examples.
