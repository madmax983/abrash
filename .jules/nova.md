## [ASCII Display Filter]
**Concept:** A post-processing effect that converts the framebuffer into an ASCII art display, mapping luminance to characters and rendering them using a built-in bitmap font.
**Fate:** Implemented
**Lesson:** Rendering simple pixel-art text efficiently across a framebuffer requires avoiding naive scaling operations or complex string allocations, and instead directly mapping pixel locations and checking simple bitmaps using shifts and masks.

## [Pencil Sketch Filter]
**Concept:** A post-processing effect that simulates a hand-drawn pencil sketch. It works by combining edge detection (to draw the strokes) with noise-driven hatching to simulate shading and texture.
**Fate:** Proposed
**Lesson:** TBD

**Concept:** A post-processing effect that simulates a hand-drawn pencil sketch. It works by combining edge detection (to draw the strokes) with noise-driven hatching to simulate shading and texture.
**Fate:** Implemented
**Lesson:** Using procedural coordinate-based hashing combined with luminance is a highly effective and very fast way to produce stylized noise patterns like hatching, completely avoiding the overhead of external random number generator libraries in tight hot loops.
