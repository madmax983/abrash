**[Performance Optimization: Unchecked Rasterizer Access]**
**Learning:** Removing bounds checks (`test_and_set` -> `test_and_set_unchecked`) in the single-pixel/empty-span path of the rasterizer yielded a ~20% performance improvement for small triangles. This path is hit frequently for sub-pixel or thin geometry.
**Action:** Look for other "checked by logic" hot paths where `unsafe` unchecked access can be justified by loop invariants.

**[Optimization Trap: Intrinsics vs Inlining]**
**Learning:** Attempting to optimize `Vec3::normalize` with `unsafe` SIMD intrinsics (`rsqrtss`) caused precision regressions in tests and violated safety policies. However, simply adding `#[inline]` to `Vec3::length` provided a ~50% speedup (11.3ns -> 5.7ns), matching the performance of the unsafe intrinsic version without the downsides.
**Action:** Always profile function call overhead and inlining (`#[inline]`) before resorting to `unsafe` intrinsics. Precision loss from fast-math approximations can break regression tests.

**[Performance Optimization: Rayon fold to flat_map_iter]**
**Learning:** Replacing `.fold(Vec::new, ...).flatten().collect()` with `.flat_map_iter(...)` in Rayon iterator chains eliminates intermediate `Vec` allocations per chunk. This reduces heap allocations significantly in parallel processing pipelines like the tile rasterizer (`submit_mesh`, `render_batch` paths).
**Action:** Always prefer `flat_map_iter` when flattening iterator results in Rayon to keep data on the stack (via returned Iterators or arrays) and avoid heap-allocating intermediate collections.
