**[Performance Optimization: Unchecked Rasterizer Access]**
**Learning:** Removing bounds checks (`test_and_set` -> `test_and_set_unchecked`) in the single-pixel/empty-span path of the rasterizer yielded a ~20% performance improvement for small triangles. This path is hit frequently for sub-pixel or thin geometry.
**Action:** Look for other "checked by logic" hot paths where `unsafe` unchecked access can be justified by loop invariants.

**[Optimization Trap: Intrinsics vs Inlining]**
**Learning:** Attempting to optimize `Vec3::normalize` with `unsafe` SIMD intrinsics (`rsqrtss`) caused precision regressions in tests and violated safety policies. However, simply adding `#[inline]` to `Vec3::length` provided a ~50% speedup (11.3ns -> 5.7ns), matching the performance of the unsafe intrinsic version without the downsides.
**Action:** Always profile function call overhead and inlining (`#[inline]`) before resorting to `unsafe` intrinsics. Precision loss from fast-math approximations can break regression tests.

**[Performance Optimization: Rayon fold to flat_map_iter]**
**Learning:** Replacing `.fold(Vec::new, ...).flatten().collect()` with `.flat_map_iter(...)` in Rayon iterator chains eliminates intermediate `Vec` allocations per chunk. This reduces heap allocations significantly in parallel processing pipelines like the tile rasterizer (`submit_mesh`, `render_batch` paths).
**Action:** Always prefer `flat_map_iter` when flattening iterator results in Rayon to keep data on the stack (via returned Iterators or arrays) and avoid heap-allocating intermediate collections.

**Optimize capacity estimations for large procedurally generated datasets**
**Learning:** While `Vec::with_capacity()` is standard practice to avoid allocations, adding an O(N) pre-pass to count specific elements (like `[` in an L-System string) or calculate exact replacement lengths for unicode characters to calculate an exact capacity for extremely long strings or datasets can cause a massive performance regression.
**Action:** When working with large procedurally expanded data, use a reasonable O(1) heuristic capacity estimate based on the current length (e.g. `String::with_capacity(current.len() * 2)`) and let the collection scale dynamically, avoiding full iteration overhead.

**[Performance Optimization: Pre-allocating SOAs based on bounds]**
**Learning:** When building physics structures like SoftBody springs from a mesh, structure-of-array (SoA) layout vectors should be pre-allocated based on mathematical upper bounds (e.g., `mesh.indices.len() * 3` for max edges) using `Vec::with_capacity()` and `HashSet::with_capacity()` to prevent heap reallocations.
**Action:** When building graphs or parsing structures where the maximum possible size is known or easily calculable, always pre-allocate collections to that maximum bound, rather than growing dynamically.
