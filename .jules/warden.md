## 2025-01-28 - [Vulnerable Dependencies]
**Threat:** Found multiple vulnerabilities in `Cargo.lock` during `cargo audit`, including bincode, fxhash, instant, paste, drm, and uds_windows.
**Defense:** These crates are used indirectly. Some have advisories or are unmaintained. Need to investigate if we can update them.

## 2025-01-28 - [Memory Safety: TriangleLists]
**Threat:** The structs `ClippedTriangles`, `PreparedTrianglesList`, `PreparedGouraudTrianglesList`, and `PreparedTexturedTrianglesList` have their `count` fields marked as `pub`. This allows safe code to manually set the `count` higher than the number of initialized elements, leading to reading uninitialized memory (Undefined Behavior) when iterating over the list, since `assume_init()` is called in an `unsafe` block assuming `count` elements are initialized.
**Defense:** Make the `count` field private and provide a safe `len()` or `count()` accessor, ensuring the invariant that `count` always reflects the number of initialized elements cannot be broken by safe code.

**2026-04-13 - Uninitialized Memory Read in PreparedTrianglesLists**
**Threat:** `PreparedTrianglesList`, `PreparedGouraudTrianglesList`, and `PreparedTexturedTrianglesList` had public `count` fields while wrapping `MaybeUninit` arrays. This allowed safe code to arbitrarily modify the length tracking, causing the internal iterators to call `.assume_init()` on uninitialized memory, leading to Undefined Behavior and potential information disclosure or crashes.
**Defense:** Made the `count` fields private across all tile binning lists and exposed a safe `count()` getter, enforcing the memory safety invariant at the module boundary.
## 2026-04-12 - [Denial of Service: Integer Overflow in Bresenham's Circle]
**Threat:** The `draw_circle` and `fill_circle` algorithms blindly used unchecked math operations (`3 - 2 * radius`) for computing the decision variable. This allowed massive malicious `radius` inputs to overflow the `i32` integers, bypassing checks or triggering unhandled panics, leading to DoS. A previous PR introduced an artificial bound `< 16384` but used an early return rather than safely panicking, masking the vulnerability.
**Defense:** Replaced the unchecked `3 - 2 * radius` math with `checked_mul` and `checked_sub` (using `map_or_else` to avoid branch lint warnings). Now the functions will safely and loudly panic with "Circle drawing integer overflow" on malicious boundaries rather than behaving unsoundly.

**2024-04-17 - Mutable Aliasing via Raw Pointers**
**Threat:** Deriving a raw pointer to read data from a buffer while simultaneously creating a mutable slice to the same buffer violates Rust's strict mutable aliasing rules and results in Undefined Behavior (UB), particularly dangerous during parallel execution where it introduces data races.
**Defense:** Avoid using raw pointers to bypass borrow checker constraints around mutable slices. Redesign algorithms (e.g. sequential in-place directional loops) or correctly partition slices (e.g., `split_at_mut`) to satisfy safety rules.
