## [Reduction]
**Bloat:** BspTextures and BspMap single-implementation traits.
**Cut:** Removed the public traits entirely and flattened MockTextures and IntegrationBspMap into concrete structs `BspTextureCache` and `BspMapData` usable by both the main engine and the tests.
**Saved:** Multiple files touched, eliminated two completely unneeded traits and simplified the dependency tree.

## [Reduction]
**Bloat:** The `Lerpable` trait and duplicate generic Bezier/spline curve functions in `curve.rs` vs `math.rs`.
**Cut:** Deleted the single-use `Lerpable` trait entirely and replaced the generic `curve.rs` functions with the concrete `Vec3` versions from `math.rs`.
**Saved:** ~140 lines of code and reduced cognitive overhead of duplicate logic.

## [Reduction]
**Bloat:** `BspTextures` and `BspMap` single-implementation traits used exclusively for test mocks, violating YAGNI and KISS.
**Cut:** Removed the traits entirely, replacing them with concrete `BspTextureCache` and `BspMapData` structs.
**Saved:** Simplified module dependency graph and removed intermediate trait bounds across renderer arguments.

## [Reduction]
**Bloat:** `Evaluable` as a trait with single implementations in `abrash-anim`, which caused dynamic dispatch (`Box<dyn Evaluable<T>>`) throughout the animation sequences, timelines and skeletal clip evaluators.
**Cut:** Replaced `Evaluable` trait with an `enum Evaluable<T>` containing `Keyframe`, `Hold` and `Sequence`. All dynamically dispatched `Box<dyn Evaluable<T>>` occurrences were removed and replaced with concrete enum variants, achieving zero-cost abstractions and keeping memory flat.
**Saved:** Removed the use of dynamic dispatch/`Box` completely across `abrash-anim` and `abrash-skeletal`.

## [Reduction]
**Bloat:** The `abrash-anim` crate had several tiny files (`hold.rs`, `keyframe.rs`, `sequence.rs`) that merely defined variants of the `Evaluable` enum. This created unnecessary module hierarchy and file switching for tightly coupled data types.
**Cut:** Consolidated these files directly into `evaluable.rs` where the `Evaluable` enum is defined. Updated imports in `timeline.rs` and `abrash-skeletal`.
**Saved:** 3 files deleted, reduced module hierarchy depth, improved discoverability of evaluable components.
